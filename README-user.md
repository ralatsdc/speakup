## Viewing Upcoming Meetings

After logging in, you'll land on the home page, which shows a list of upcoming meetings. Each meeting displays:

- **Date** and **meeting type**
- **Theme** and **word of the day** (if set)

## Signing Up for a Role

To volunteer for a meeting role:

1. Find the meeting on the home page.
2. Look for roles marked as **Open** (no one assigned yet).
3. Click the **"Sign Up"** button next to the role you want.

Your name will appear in the role assignment immediately — no page reload needed.

**Good to know:**
- You can sign up for **one role per meeting**. (Officers may take additional roles.)
- To **drop a role** you've already claimed, click the **"Drop"** button next to your assignment.
- Guest accounts cannot sign up for roles. If you're listed as a guest and want to start taking roles, ask your club admin to update your account.

## Adding Notes to Your Role

If you're assigned a role — especially a speech role — you can add notes that will appear on the public agenda (e.g., your speech title and Pathways project).

1. Click the **pencil icon** next to your role.
2. Type your notes in the text field that appears.
3. Click **Save**.

Officers can edit notes on any role, not just their own.

## Viewing the Meeting Agenda

Each meeting has a public agenda page that anyone can view (no login required). The agenda shows:

- Meeting date, theme, and word of the day
- All sessions and role assignments
- Notes added by role holders
- Zoom link (if applicable)

You can also **download the agenda as a Word document** using the download button on the agenda page. This is handy for printing or sharing.

## Checking In at Meetings

At the meeting venue, a **check-in kiosk** is available (usually on a tablet near the entrance). No login is needed.

- **Members**: Find your name in the grid and tap it to check in. Your button turns green to confirm.
- **Guests**: Fill out the guest sign-in form with your name and email.

## Emails You May Receive

The club admin may send you emails through the app:

- **Meeting reminders** — Sent before a meeting. If you have a role, you'll get a reminder with your assignment details and a link to the agenda. If you don't have a role, you may receive a request to help fill open spots.
- **Post-meeting feedback** — After a meeting, you may receive personalized feedback on your role from the meeting evaluators or officers.
- **Announcements** — General club news and updates sent by the admin.
