            <p class="lead">
                Are you paralyzed by the mere thought of standing in front of an audience,
                speaking up at a meeting, presenting your ideas or pitching your business concept?
            </p>
            <p>
                At Speak Up Cambridge, we help members overcome public speaking anxiety through
                fast-paced, engaging meetups. We follow the Toastmasters International curriculum
                while adding our own variations. Meetings feature prepared speeches, impromptu
                speaking exercises, and a 30-second introduction round.
            </p>
            <p>
                We meet on the 2nd and 4th Wednesday of each month from 6:45&ndash;8:45 PM,
                with both in-person and online options available. Visitors can attend free as guests.
            </p>
