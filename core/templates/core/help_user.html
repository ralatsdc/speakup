    <li><strong>Date</strong> and <strong>meeting type</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Theme</strong> and <strong>word of the day</strong> (if set)</li>
    <li><strong>Zoom link</strong> (if the meeting is hybrid or virtual)</li>
    <li>A table of <strong>roles</strong> showing who is signed up for each one</li>

    <li>Look for roles marked as <strong>Open</strong> (no one assigned yet).</li>
    <li>Click the <strong>"Sign Up"</strong> button next to the role you want.</li>
</ol>
<p>Your name will appear in the role assignment immediately &mdash; no page reload needed.</p>

<p><strong>Good to know:</strong></p>
<ul>

    <li>Type your notes in the text field that appears.</li>

    <li><strong>Post-meeting feedback</strong> &mdash; After a meeting, you may receive personalized feedback on your role from the meeting evaluators or officers.</li>
